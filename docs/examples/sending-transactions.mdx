title: Sending Transactions
---

You can submit a transaction to the network using the Access API client.

```go
import "github.com/onflow/flow-go-sdk/client"

// connect to an emulator running locally
c, err := client.New("localhost:3569")
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to connect to emulator")
}

ctx := context.Background()

err = c.SendTransaction(ctx, tx)
if err != nil {
    panic("failed to send transaction")
}
```
